# Earthquake-Data-Structure-Project

## Description
This repository contains the source code of my **Earthquake Data Structure Project**, which I developed in **Java** during my **3rd Semester** for the subject **"Data Structures & Algorithms"** in my **B.E Software Engineering Program**.

## Features
- Implementation of **data structures** to store and process earthquake data.
- Efficient searching and sorting algorithms applied to earthquake datasets.
- Interactive Java-based program for analyzing earthquake patterns.
- Object-oriented design principles for maintainability and scalability.

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
- **Java-supported IDE** (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or a text editor with command-line support

## How to Run
